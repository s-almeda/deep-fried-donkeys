<h2>Hi!</h2>
This repo contains the code from the CS61A/DATAC88C Fall 2024 first lecture demo presented by shm.

It contains code to transcribe the first shrek movie, to manipulate the transcribed text (which is included), and automate the process of making silly clips out of the movie. 
It also has a mini demo at the end that showcases a simple drawing canvas.

The code file is called ```shrek.ipynb.```

This is a <em>jupyter notebook</em> file! It allows you to run Python code in blocks (rather than all at once) and add lots of lil text notes around those blocks, which is useful for a demo or tutorial.

You can view and run Jupyter notebooks using a program called Jupyter. Google Colab also allows you to view and edit jupyter notebooks.

you will probably have to install a few things (like jupyter, and ffmpeg) before this code will work. 

If you use pip to install python packages, you can use the following command to install all the packages needed: 

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

and if this makes no sense to you, no worries. come to my office hours and we can chat.... or just come back to this later once you've had more practice with Python and coding in general, and done a starter project or two. If you keep marching on your coding journey, I promise lots of initially bewildering stuff will make way more sense later! 

sparkles,

shm
