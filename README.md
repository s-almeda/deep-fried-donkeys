Hi!
The code is in the file called shrek.ipynb
It is a jupyter notebook file! 
(it has blocks of code and text) 
you have to install a bunch of things (like jupyter, and ffmpeg) before it will work.
If you use pip to install python packages, you can run the following package to install everything I had installed: 
pip install -r requirements.txt

and if this is all very confusing, no worries. come back to this later once you've had more practice with Python in general, and I'm sure it will make more sense!
